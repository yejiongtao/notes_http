1. overview of HTTP
	Http uses reliable data-transmission protocols
		it guarantees that your data will not be damaged or scrambled in transit

	MIME type (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension)
		Web servers attach a MIME type to all HTTP object data
		A MIME type is a textual label, represented as a primary object type and a specific subtype, separated by a slash
			text/html
			text/plain
			image/gif
			application/vnd.ms-powerpoint
	URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)
		Each web server resource has a name
		URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
			for now, almost every URI is a URL
			includes three parts
				scheme, which describes the protocol used to access the resource
				server address
				the resource on the server
		URN (Uniform Resource Name)
			a unique name for a particular piece of content, independent of where the resource currently resides
			need a supporting infrastructure to resolve resource locations
			for now it's not widely used
	transaction
		An HTTP transaction consists of a request command, and a response result
	message
		HTTP messages are simple, line-oriented sequences of plain text
		consists of three part
			start line
				indicating what to do for a request or what happened for a response
			header fields
				Zero or more header fields. 
				Each header field consists of a name and a value, separated by a colon (:) for easy parsing. 
				The headers end with a blank line
			body
				an optional message body containing any kind of data(e.g., images, videos, audio tracks, software applications)
		sample
			request message
				GET /test/hi.txt HTTP/1.0
				Accept: text/*			// means the client accepts text
				Accept_Language: en,fr		// there must be a blank line even if there's no header
								// a blank line here, specifying the end of headers
			response message	
				HTTP/1.0 200 OK			// 'OK' is a reason-phrase, it's just for human consumption, so it can be anything
				Content-type: text/plain
				Content-length: 19

				Hi! I'm a message!
	connection
		HTTP is an application layer protocol, which is layered over TCP/IP
			actually the Internet itself is based on TCP/IP
			TCP is connection oriented
				every time you want to do a HTTP transaction, a TCP connection must be established
		TCP provides
			Error-free data transportation
			In-order delivery (data will always arrive in the order in which it was sent)
			Unsegmented data stream (can dribble out data in any size at any time)
		use Telnet to talk to HTTP server
			you can use Telnet to establish a TCP connection with the web server
			and then directy send plain text to it
				it will treat you as a web client and respond to you 
	other architectural components of the web
		besides web server and client, there are other components
			Proxies
				HTTP intermediaries that sit between clients and servers
				act as a proxy for the user, accessing the server on the user's behalf
				often used for security, cuz it can filter requests and responses
			Caches
				HTTP storehouses that keep copies of popular web pages close to clients
			Gateways
				Special web servers that connect to other applications
				often used to convert HTTP traffic to another protocol
			Tunnels
				Special proxies that blindly forward HTTP communications
				often used to transport non-HTTP data over one or more HTTP connections, without looking at the data
					e.g. carrying encrypted SSL traffic through an HTTP connection, allowing SSL traffic through corporate firewalls that permit only web traffic
			Agents
				Semi-intelligent web clients that make automated HTTP requests
				Any application that issues web requests is an HTTP agent
					e.g. web browsers

2. URL
	syntax
		although URl syntax varies among schemes, most URLs adhere to a general URL syntax
			<scheme>://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<path>;<params>?<query>#<frag>
		parameter
			Params are name/value pairs. 
			A URL can contain multiple params fields, separated from themselves and the rest of the path by semicolons (;).
				http://www.baidu.com;type=d;item=1011
		path
			can be broken into path segments, and each segment can have its own params
				http://www.joes-hardware.com/hammers;sale=false/index.html;graphics=true
		query
			Used by some schemes to pass parameters to active applications (such as databases, bulletin boards, search engines, and other Internet gateways)
				The query component of the URL is passed along to a gateway resource
			There is no common format for the contents of the query component. 
				It is separated from the rest of the URL by the “?” character.
					http://www.joes-hardware.com?item=100&color=blue
		frag
			A name for a piece or part of the resource. 
			The frag field is not passed to the server when referencing the object; it is used internally by the client. 
			It is separated from the rest of the URL by the “#” character.
	URL shortcuts
		relative url
			can be used in html file, the absolute url can be resolve from the relative url and the base url
			base url
				you can specify a base url in <base> html flag
				if you don't, the base url will be the parent of the html file
					e.g. in http://WebReference.com/html/about.html, base url is http://WebReference.com/html/
			relative url
				about.html
				./about.html		// equals to about.html
				../experts/		// go back to the upper level
		expandomatic url
			Some browsers try to expand URLs automatically
				Hostname expansion
				history expansion
		encoding characters in URL
			why?
				unsafe characters
					some protocols use transmission methods that will strip off certain characters
				reserved characters
					e.g. '/'
			how?
				a '%' followed with two hex number, e.g. %5E
			so if you want to use unsafe or reserved characters in url, you should encode them
				in high level programming like Java, just use some methods to do it for you 
			and remember to decode when you get a url
		schemes
			http
			https
				similar to http
				uses SSL to provide end-to-end encryption of HTTP connection
				with default port of 443
			mailto
				quite different from the standard URL
				mailto:joe@cisco.com
			ftp
			rstp, rstpu
				for audio and video media resources that can be retrieved through the Real Time Streaming Protocol
				The “u” in the rtspu scheme denotes that the UDP protocol is used to retrieve the resource
			file
				denotes files directly accessible on a given host machine (by local disk, a network filesystem, or some other file-sharing system)
			news
				used to access specific articles or newsgroups
				a news URL in itself does not contain sufficient information to locate the resource
					It is the interpreting application’s job to acquire this information from the user
						for example, you specify the default NNTP (news) server in your browser
			telnet
				sed to access interactive services. 
				It does not represent an object per se, but an interactive application (resource) accessible via the telnet protocol
