1. Web servers
	different forms of web server
		general-purpose software web servers
			run on standard computer systems
			most popular ones
				Apache, Microsoft, nginx, Google

		web server appliances
			in which the software comes preinstalled and preconfigured on a computer
			remove the need to install and configure software and often greatly simplify administration
			however often less flexible and feature-rich
				and the server hardware is not easily repurposeabel or upgradeable

		embedded web servers
			implemented in a small number of computer chips, making them perfect administration consoles for consumer devices
			allow users to administer their consumer devices using a convenient web browser interface.
	
	what web servers do
		set up connection --accept a client connection, or close if the client is unwanted
			client hostname identification
				Most web servers can be configured to convert client IP addresses into client hostnames, using “reverse DNS.” 
					can be used for detailed access control and logging
				but hostname lookups may take a long time
					so high-capacity web servers either disable hostname resolution or enable it only for particular content
			ident protocol for client identification
				if the client supports ident protocol, 
					when the http connection established, server sends a request to the client's 113 port for the username
				ident can work inside organizations, but it does not work well across the public Internet
					because of firewalls or something

		receive request --read an HTTP request message from the network
			Different web server architectures 
				single-threaded
					process one request at a time
				multiprocess and multithreaded
					often puts a limit on the maximum number of threads/processes
				multiplexed I/O servers
					all the connections are watched for activity
						when something happens with the connection, some processing is performed with that connection
					threads and processes are not tied up waiting on idle connections
				multiplexed nultithreaded
					(to take advantage of multiple CPUs in the computer platform)
					Multiple threads (often one per physical processor) each watch the open connections (or a subset of the open connections) and perform a small amount of work on each connection

		process request --interpret the request message and take action
		access resource --access the resource specified in the message
			docroot
				a special folder in the web server filesystem reserved for web content
				vitual hosted docroots
					Virtually hosted web servers host multiple web sites on the same web server
					you can specify a docroot for each site
			directory listing
				the path of the request may be a directory, in which case the server can perform the followings
					return an error
					return a special, default, "index file" instead of the directory
					scan the directory, and return an HTMl page containing the contents
			dynamic content resource mapping
				mapping the resource to an executable
			Server-Side Includes(SSI)
				If a resource is flagged as containing server-side includes, the server processes the resource contents before sending them to the client.
				The contents are scanned for certain special patterns (often contained inside special HTML comments), 
					which can be variable names or embedded scripts. 
					The special patterns are replaced with the values of variables or the output of executable scripts. 
				This is an easy way to create dynamic content.

		construct response --create the HTTP response message with the right headers
			a message with an entity body often has Content-Type and Content-Length headers

			redirection, used for	
				Permanently moved resources
				temporarily moved resources
				URL augmentation
					to rewrite URLs, often to embed context
				load balancing
					redirect to a less heavily loaded server
				server affinity
					Web servers may have local information for certain users; 
					a server can redirect the client to a server that contains information about the client
				Canonicalizing directory name
					When a client requests a URI for a directory name without a trailing slash,
					most web servers redirect the client to a URI with the slash added, so that relative links work correctly

		send response --send the response back to the client
			For persistent connections, the connection may stay open, 
				in which case the server needs to be extra cautious to compute the Content-Length header correctly, 
				or the client will have no way of knowing when a response ends

		log trasaction --place notes about the completed transaction in a log file
	
2. common ways of detecting the end of a Socket message
		Closing the connection at the end of the message
		Putting the length of the message before the data itself
		Using a separator; some value which will never occur in the normal data (or would always be escaped somehow)
	HTTP applies all these three
		if there's no entity body, the message ends with an extra LRCF
		if the connection is not persistent, the message ends when the connection is closed
		otherwise, you got to specify the Content-Length
